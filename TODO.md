# TODO


- [ ] enable advanced chugins {faust, warpbug, fluidsynth}

- [x] complete api wrapping, missing a bunch of params, methods, and callbacks

- [ ] repl: save each iteration of entered scripts in `~/.pychuck/code`, these should be editable in the repl itself. Ideally there should a window which display all of the shreds in a table
